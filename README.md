# Hub Course List Block
*moodle-block_hubcourselist*

The Hub Course Block plugin is a part of a suite of three plugins designed to replace the core Moodle Hub code: Since Moodle 3.3, this Publish function inside courses has been removed and the previous MoodleNet Hub will be replaced by a new MoodleNet strategy that is under construction. While that is under construction,

The purpose of this Hub Course Block plugin is to summarize and display course list in a Moodle site and to manipulate usersâ€™ interaction of filtering and searching for courses in site. This plugin is fully dependent to the hub course info block ([moodle-block_hubcourseinfo](https://github.com/ponlawat-w/moodle-block_hubcourseinfo)). In other words, listed courses in the plugin must have an instance of hub course info block, so that it contains hub course metadata.

This plugin is a course block type and displays on frontpage and user dashboard for both site users and guests (non-authorized users). It lists hub courses in the site with functionality of course searching, filtering, result sorting and pagination.

Information for this plugin is available from Don Hinkelman ([hinkelman(at)mac.com](mailto:hinkelman@mac.com)) and programming support is by Ponlawat Weerapanpisit ([ponlawat_w(at)cmu.ac.th](mailto:ponlawat_w@cmu.ac.th)).
